## About

Advent of Code is a series of daily programming challenges that test problem-solving and algorithmic skills. Each day presents two parts of a puzzle, often requiring innovative and efficient solutions. Learn more about Advent of Code [here](https://adventofcode.com/).

This repository serves as my attempt to solve all 2024 puzzles using Python. Each solution is tailored to the specific problem but aims to prioritize clarity and efficiency.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
.
├── day01
│   ├── real_input.txt     # Input data for Day 1
│   ├── example_input.txt  # Example data for Day 1
│   ├── part1.py           # Solution for Day 1, Part 1
│   ├── part2.py           # Solution for Day 1, Part 2
│   └── README.md          # Description of the Day 1 challenge
├── day02
